PawPal is a mobile application designed for pet adoption. Developed using Android Studio, this project was created as part of my second-year college requirements for the Software Engineering course.

The app simplifies the process of adopting pets by offering an easy-to-use interface for browsing available pets, filtering by type, and directly contacting shelters as well as to owners.
